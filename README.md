# ProgrammingLanguages
A collection of the programming languages that I use. This repository is mainly used to look up syntaxes etc.


# C#

To run the c# files, download a command line tool via dotnet: dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script
now you can run dotnet-script <..name of your file..>

# Dart

To run dart files, download dart compiler and type: dart run <..name of your file..>

# Java

To run java files type: javac <..name of your file..> that will produce a .class file which you 
can run by typing: java <..name of your class file..>

# Javascript

To run javascript files, you need to install nodejs on your machine and type: node <..name of your file..>

# Swift

To run swift files you'll need a macos (maybe). type: swift <..name of your file..>
